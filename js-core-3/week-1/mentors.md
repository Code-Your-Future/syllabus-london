## Delivery Resources

e.g. Presentations and Notes

## To Be Improved

- Could we make exercises that are even harder to enable them to use the tools more
- Build in some more checking for understanding
- We didn't think about `warnings` at all.
  - "Don't ignore errors and warnings"
  - "Start from the first warning"

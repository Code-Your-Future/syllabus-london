### Running a very simple web-server

In the in-class exercise it's important to go through the steps off

1. Viewing a simple Node Server
2. Creating a simple Node Server as a class
3. Editing a simple Node Server individually (or small groups)

This slow exposure to a new topic should give the students time to learn through repetition.
